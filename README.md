Git Automate is a `<script>` that allows `<developer>` to do `<automate>` certain git processes. 

When a new project is created using command `<create project_name>` it does couple of things
* Creates a directory for a project and navigates to that directory
* Creates a README.md file similar to this
* Creates a remote repository in github with same project name
* Initailises git in the project directory
* Creates new connection to remote repository <git remote add origin>
* Performs git add, git commit and push to master
