Git Automate is a `bash script` that allows `developer` to do `automate ` certain git processes. 

When a new project is created using command `<create project_name>` it does couple of things
* Creates a directory for a project and navigates to that directory
* Creates a README.md file similar to this (For this add the provided `SAMPLE_README.md` file to your FILEPATH)
* Creates a remote repository in github with same project name
* Initailises git in the project directory
* Creates new connection to remote repository <git remote add origin>
* Performs git add, git commit and push to master


## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
<!--- These are just example requirements. Add, duplicate or remove as required --->
* Define your Git `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD` in .env file of your system
* Also, generate a `GITOAUTHTOKEN` ([Click here for OAuth tokens](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/extending-github/git-automation-with-oauth-tokens#step-1-get-an-oauth-token)) and define gitOAuth token of .env file in your system

## Using the script

To execute the script, follow these steps:

```
# Add execute attribute to the script
> chmod +x automate_git.sh
> create <Name of repository> <Bool: Private repo?> (True for private; False for public)
# Example
> create test_repo true
```

Also, have a look at these variables used in the script:

```
# var 1 ($1): Name of the repo
# Var 2 ($2): private or public repo
# USERNAME: define git username in .env file of your system
# PASSWORD: define git password in .env file of your system
# GITOAUTHTOKEN: define git O Auth token of .env file in your system
# FILEPATH: Path to your project directory
```
